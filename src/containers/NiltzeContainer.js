        <p>
          Hey bienvenidos! Our paths have intertwined and you have made it here.
          Whether it be just in passing or maybe we know each other, or maybe
          there is something deeper, whatever the reason, I value your presence
          no matter the intent. I created this site as a way to tie me to this
          plane, as I feel my connection loosening. My experience so far has
          been fortunate enough to carry images of family and love that inject
          me with strength and purpose. However, I have been hijacked by a dark
          presence that refuses to let go and has turned me into a shadow of a
          person that now wanders from one island of existance to the next.
          These islands are rich with character and love, but because of it's
          grip I struggle to translate, adapt, and ground myself. To expel it
          requires shedding everything I ever thought I wanted so that I may see
          if I'm capable of, or even want to vanquish the demon. This is the
          journey the great counsciousness has asked of me and at the very least
          I hope that the next incarnation of myself can navigate this plane
          with more tools and confidence at their disposal. I believe in the
          deepest part of my soul that something was taken from me, from my
          people, that has yet to be rebalanced. The memory of this imbalance is
          so old and miticulisouly erased that the path is no longer clear as to
          how to right the wrong. I can't use my personal story anymore to
          figure this out, it just enables this creature so instead I will use
          my ancenstral blood and artistic gifts to help reshape this stolen
          treasure and give back to my people. The same people I was groomed to
          hate and be ashamed of. This greeting will change over time, and I
          will always keep and display past iterations because what I'm
          attempting will require honesty, maleability, and openness. I end this
          message by saying: To my people I am greatly sorry for abandoning you.
          I should have known that by making you all stronger I become stronger.
          To my family: I will always love you unconditionally, and I hope that
          I can make a great enough sacrifice that I can return to you complete.
          To my self: I am sorry for hating you for so long, most of it not even
          aware. I still sense you in me. Estos es para todo ustedes.
        </p>
